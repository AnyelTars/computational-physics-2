    "## 6. (10 points): Two-body problem and python script\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem consists of developing your own standalone python module to simulate a two-body problem. The module accepts initial parameters from the user and delivers customised simulations of two-body systems where the interaction between the two bodies is of gravitational nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity we will assume that the most massive object of mass $M$ is our Sun and it is located at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$, while the other object is the Earth of mass $m$ and orbits around the Sun. In this coordinate system the position of the Earth is $\\vec{r}=x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y}$, which is the vector pointing from the Sun to the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "We can write the ODE system describing the motion of Earth as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt}=\\vec{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}=-\\frac{G\\,m\\,M}{r^3}\\vec{r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $m$ cancels out. In addition, Kepler’s third law for $M\\gg m$ states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$4\\,\\pi^2\\,a^3\\approx{G\\,M}\\,T^2$, \n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the elliptical relative motion of one object relative to the other and the $T$ is the orbital period. If $a$ is in astronomical units (where $1 AU\\equiv$ distance between the Sun and the Earth), $T$ is in $yr$, and $M$ is in solar masses, then $a^3 = T^2$, so $4\\,\\pi^2 \\approx G\\,M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At $t=0$, we will place the Earth at perihelion (i.e., at the point in the orbit at which the Earth is closest to the Sun). Thus:\n",

    "### Code development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a single python script **kepler.py**, adequately organised in classes and functions, that:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) initialises the two-body problem on a 2D cartesian grid with an option to save the initial map (if the user wishes to do so). Use the Argparse Library to facilitate user customisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) includes two methods to carry out Runge-Kutta integrations (RK2 and RK3).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) includes a function for the slopes given by the above equations of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) includes a run class to integrate the above system of ODEs for $T=5$ orbital periods and saves the history of the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun into an output file. **Note:** Both ODEs need to be integrated simultaneously, so you don't need separate functions for the integration of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) includes an animation class that reads the Earth's orbital history and returns a GIF animation containing the Earth position and velocity at different times. The user should be able to turn on a flag at runtime to indicate if the GIF animation is desired. Use the Argparse Library to add this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) accepts as inputs from the user: $e$, $T$, and the numerical method (\"RK2\" or \"RK3\") to update the ODE system. Use the Argparse Library to add this functionality. **Note:** Please provide an example of how I should execute your code in the README.md file and include your simulations in the **outputfolder** for a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a single python notebook **analysis.ipynb**, add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "(g) Use your script to generate two simulations: one for $e=0.01671$ and one for $e=0.25$ (which is Pluto's eccentricity) for $T=5$ and RK2. What would happen if Earth would have the eccentrity of Pluto? It may be helpful to compare the orbital history for both values of $e$ in a single plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "(h) Use your script to measure the convergence of RK3 for $e=0.01671$ by integrating at a number of different time steps. To analyse convergence, you need to define some measure for the error, e.g., you can consider the change in radius after one period (i.e., at $T=1$). Thus, you should add additional functions for this to your code in **kepler.py**. **Note:** Please include your own simulations in the **outputfolder** for a reference."

    "## 7. (10 points): Heat equation and MPI point-to-point parallelisation\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem aims at parallelising a python routine using MPI point-to-point parallelisation. The python routine uses the FFT method we studied in class to solve the heat equation for an initial cosine temperature profile. You can find the base code (**diffusion.py**) here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-2/blob/main/exams/diffusion.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to study diffusion for a long time scale, and thus we wish to reduce at least some of the computing time using the MPI library. Download the serial code and carry out the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Copy the default script above and create a **diffusionMPI.py** script. Edit the new script, importing the **MPI** and **mpi4py** libraries and adding time stamps around the main operations performed by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Add the MPI communicator to get the size and core information of your computer. Also, set up the workload parameters for each rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Now we want to parallelise the iFFT part of the code. Since the solution is already stored in a 2D array, we can split the time axis and distribute it along the processors. Look for the following lines in the code and use point-to-point communication to parallelise your routine. When it is done, test your parallelisation by running the code with 1 and 2 processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# We want to parallelise the code from here onwards\n",
    "for k in range(len(t)):\n",
    "    inv_u_solution[k, :] = np.fft.ifft(u_solution[k, :])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) As you have noticed, the plotting section of the code is not parallelised yet, so the PNG image contains half the solution. Thus, our job is to parallelise the section below too. There are several ways to achieve this, but we will use point-to-point communication, so your task is to make all ranks $\\neq 0$ **send** their sub-arrays to rank $=0$. Then, rank $=0$ **receives** them, reconstructs the full array, and makes the plot. Make sure your code is memory efficient.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Copy your **diffusionMPI.py** script to the CEDIA cluster via SSH, reserve computing resources (e.g. $8$ cores), then run your code using mpirun/mpiexec. Export log files from each run, so that the run times can be analysed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Write a python notebook **diffusionMPI.py** that opens the log files produced by the serial run and different parallel runs. Make a plot with computing time on the Y-axis and number of cores on the X-axis. Display Amdahl's law, compare it to your results, and comment on the findings. **Note:** Please add all your log files and plots to the **outputfolder**.\n",
