    "## Predictor-Corrector Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Given any time and state value, the function, $F(t, S(t))$, returns the change of state $\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$. **Predictor-corrector** methods of solving initial value problems improve the approximation accuracy of non-predictor-corrector methods by querying the $F$ function several times at different locations (predictions), and then using a weighted average of the results (corrections) to update the state. Essentially, it uses two formulas: the **predictor** and **corrector**. The predictor is an explicit formula and first estimates the solution at $t_{j+1}$, i.e. we can use Euler method or some other methods to finish this step. After we obtain the solution $S(t_{j+1})$, we can apply the corrector to improve the accuracy. Using the found $S(t_{j+1})$ on the right-hand side of an otherwise implicit formula, the corrector can calculate a new, more accurate solution. \n",

    "which computes the solution at $S(t_{j+1})$ from $S(t_j)$ but using the derivative from $S\\left(t_{j} + \\frac{h}{2}\\right)$."
