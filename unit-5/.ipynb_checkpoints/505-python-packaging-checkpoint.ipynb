    "Let's look at the structure of creating an installable python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python packaging system is constantly evolving, and the current recommendations\n",
    "of tools is list here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work on an example that builds on the Mandelbrot set exercise\n",
    "from our matplotlib discussion.  Our example is hosted here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-2/tree/main/unit-5/mymodule\n",
    "\n",
    "On your local computer, if you have `git` installed, you can clone this via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/wbandabarragan/computational-physics-2/tree/main/unit-5/mymodule.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory structure appears as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mymodule\n",
    "├── mymodule\n",
    "│   ├── __init__.py\n",
    "│   └── mandel.py\n",
    "└── README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a rather common way of structuring a project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The top-level `mymodule` directory is not part of the python\n",
    "  package, but instead is where the source control (e.g. git) begins,\n",
    "  and also hosts setup files that are used for installation\n",
    "\n",
    "* `mymodule/mymodule` is the actual python module that we will load.\n",
    "   To make python recognize this as a module, we need an `__init__.py`\n",
    "   file there -- it can be completely empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The actual `*.py` files that make up our module are in `mymodule/mymodule`\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, this package does not appear in our python search path, so\n",
    "the only way to load it is to work in the top-level `mymodule/`\n",
    "directory, and then we can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mymodule.mandel\n",
    "fig = mymodule.mandel.mandelbrot(256)\n",
    "fig.savefig(\"test.png\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mymodule.mandel import mandelbrot\n",
    "```"
