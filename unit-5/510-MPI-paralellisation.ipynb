    "Let’s try running this code on multiple processes. This is done using the **mpiexec** command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many environments also provide an **mpirun** command, which usually - but not always - works the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible, you should use mpiexec and not mpirun, in order to guarantee more consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MPI - mpiexec vs mpirun\n",
    "\n",
    "- MPI stands for **‘message passing interface’** and is a message passing standard which is designed to work on a variety of parallel computing architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MPI standard defines how syntax and semantics of a library of routines. There are a number of implementations of this standard including OpenMPI, MPICH2, and MS MPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The primary difference between mpiexec and mpirun is that mpiexec is defined as part of the MPI standard, while mpirun is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different implementations of MPI (i.e. OpenMPI, MPICH, MS MPI, etc.) are not guaranteed to implement mpirun, or might implement different options for mpirun.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technically, the MPI standard doesn’t actually require that MPI implementations implement mpiexec either, but the standard does at least describe guidelines for how mpiexec should work. Because of this, mpiexec is generally the preferred command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The general format for launching a code on multiple processes is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a **example2.py** script that writes \"Hello World\" and execute it in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wladimir$ mpiexec -n 2 python example_mpi.py\n",
    "Hello World!\n",

    "When you execute the above command, mpiexec launches 2 different instances of python example1.py simultaneously, which each print “Hello World!”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, as long as you have at least 2 processors on the machine you are running on, each process will be launched on a different processor; however, certain environment variables and optional arguments to mpiexec can change this behavior. Each process runs the code in example2.py independently of the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MPI communicator:\n",
    "\n",
    "It might not be obvious yet, but the processes mpiexec launches aren’t completely unaware of one another. The mpiexec adds each of the processes to an MPI communicator, which enables each of the processes to send and receive information to one another via MPI. The MPI communicator that spans all of the processes launched by mpiexec is called **MPI.COMM_WORLD.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In mpi4py, communicators are class objects, and we can query information about them through their class functions. Edit example2.py so that it reads as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mpi4py import MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    world_comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD\n",
    "    world_size = world_comm.Get_size()\n",
    "    my_rank = world_comm.Get_rank()\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"World Size: \" + str(world_size) + \"   \" + \"Rank: \" + str(my_rank))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code we first import mpi4py. Then, we get the communicator that spans all of the processes, which is called **MPI.COMM_WORLD.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The communicator’s **Get_size()** function tells us the total number of processes within that communicator. Each of these processes is assigned a unique rank, which is an integer that ranges from **0** to **world_size - 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of a process allows it to be identified whenever processes communicate with one another. For example, in some cases we might want rank 2 to send some information to rank 4, or we might want rank 0 to receive information from all of the other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling **world_comm.Get_rank()** returns the rank of the process that called it within world_comm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we execute it in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wladimir$ mpiexec -n 2 python example2.py\n",
    "World Size: 2   Rank: 0\n",
    "World Size: 2   Rank: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the **world_comm.Get_size()** function returns 2, which is the total number of ranks we told mpiexec to run with (through the -n argument). Each of the processes is assigned a rank in the range of 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ranks may not necessarily print out their messages in order; whichever rank reaches the print function first will print out its message first. If you run the code again with more processors, the ranks are likely to print their messages in a different order."
