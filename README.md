## Course description:
This is an advanced course on object-oriented programming for physics. It is the second module of the computational physics series taught at Yachay Tech. The course focuses on introducing advanced numerical methods and simulation techniques used in physics, and provides an overview of recent progress made in several areas of scientific computing. The course includes detailed step-by-step examples of how to design software and use parallel programming to solve problems in physics. Topics range from advanced data analysis, through ordinary and partial differential equations, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, to basic thermodynamic and fluid simulations. Each section of the course includes practical examples on different areas of science and technology in which computational physics and high-performance computing have played a major role in the recent years.
